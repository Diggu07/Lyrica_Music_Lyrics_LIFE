- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Lyrica_Music_Lyrics_LIFE
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` file with your configuration:
   - Set a secure `SECRET_KEY`
   - Configure `MONGO_URI` and `DB_NAME`
   - Add email settings for password reset (optional)

5. **Start MongoDB**
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system or update the `MONGO_URI` in `.env` to point to your MongoDB instance.

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
